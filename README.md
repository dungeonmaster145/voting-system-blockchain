Blockchain-Based Voting System 🗳️⛓️
Overview
A decentralized, tamper-proof voting system built on blockchain technology that ensures vote immutability, transparency, and voter anonymity while maintaining audit trails.
Why This System?
Traditional voting systems face challenges:

❌ Centralized control & single points of failure
❌ Vote tampering possibilities
❌ Lack of transparency in vote counting
❌ Difficult audit trails

Our blockchain solution provides:

✅ Immutability - Votes cannot be changed once recorded
✅ Transparency - Anyone can verify the chain integrity
✅ Decentralization - No single authority controls the system
✅ Anonymity - Voter privacy is preserved
✅ Auditability - Complete voting history is traceable

Core Concepts
1. Blockchain Fundamentals

Block: Container holding vote data, timestamp, and cryptographic hash
Chain: Linked blocks where each block references the previous block's hash
Hash: Cryptographic fingerprint ensuring data integrity
Immutability: Changing any block invalidates all subsequent blocks

2. Voting Flow
Voter Registration → Identity Verification → Anonymous Token Generation 
→ Vote Casting → Block Creation → Chain Validation → Vote Recorded
3. Key Features

One Person, One Vote: Voter tokens prevent double voting
Cryptographic Security: SHA-256 hashing for block integrity
Tamper Detection: Chain validation detects any modifications
Distributed Consensus: (Simplified) validation mechanism

Entity Relationships

Voter → generates anonymous VoterToken
VoterToken → casts Vote
Vote → stored in Block
Block → linked in Blockchain

Technical Stack

Language: Java 17+
Framework: Spring Boot
Hashing: SHA-256 (MessageDigest)
Data Structure: LinkedList for blockchain
Concurrency: Thread-safe operations

Key Algorithms
1. Block Hashing
Hash = SHA256(previousHash + timestamp + voteData + nonce)
2. Chain Validation
For each block:
  - Verify current hash is correctly calculated
  - Verify previous hash matches previous block
  - Detect any tampering
3. Double Voting Prevention
voterToken → check if already used → reject/accept vote
Security Features

Cryptographic Hashing: SHA-256 ensures data integrity
Chain Linkage: Each block depends on previous block's hash
Voter Anonymization: Separate identity from vote through tokens
Tamper Evidence: Any modification breaks the chain
Audit Trail: Complete immutable voting history
